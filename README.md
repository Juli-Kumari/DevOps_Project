Github Actions

## Advantages of Github Action over Jenkins
1. No installation needed e.g. no need to add plugins and all
2. Can execute jobs in parallel with no efforts 
3. Actions will be available for almost all possible steps (https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides)
4. Access rughts to work with github actions

   ##Notes:-
   1. uses: actions/setup-java@v4  -> here 'actions' is present that's mean it's officially present in github action.
   2. uses: axrioty/setup-selenium -> someone has created this, we will use it our project.
